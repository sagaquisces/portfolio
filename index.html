          <h2>Welcome</h2>
          <p class="lead">Carpe Diem</span>. <em>Enjoy the day</em>. It's a fact of our modern society that virtually all people now surf the web. This implies they enjoy it, but they only will if the surf is good. As web developers, we want to create that web experience along the way that makes the surfer want to catch our wave and ride it all the way to shore.</p>
          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>Originally from Pasadena, California, my first passion was music. I learned how to play the <strong>viola</strong> and <strong>piano</strong> at an early age and later developed as a <strong>bass-baritone</strong>, becoming an opera singer.</p>

          <p>My web programming interests developed after my first college experience in <em>MIS</em> (Management Information Systems) as I was embarking on a music degree in composition. I found I had the same thrill of creation from building a website as a I did for writing a piece.</p>

          <h3>Some Favorite Activities</h3>

          <ul>
            <li>Listening to music of forgotten composers such as <em>Giuseppe Martucci</em> and <em>Kurt Atterberg</em></li>
            <li>Drinking lots of water</li>
            <li>Web programming.</li>
            <li><strong>Walking</strong>, whether on a mountain trail or downtown.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Goals as a web programmer:</h3>

          <ol>
            <li>Learn HTML</li>
            <li>Learn CSS</li>
            <li>Learn Javascript</li>
            <li>Learn GIT</li>
          </ol>
